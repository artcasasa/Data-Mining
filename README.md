In this section, we showcase various data visualization charts created during the course. These charts provide insights into different datasets and demonstrate the application of data mining techniques in real-world scenarios.

- **Temperature Anomalies Over Time** - An interactive chart showing global temperature changes over the years.
- **Product-Helpfulness Network (Top 100 Products)** - A visualization showcasing the relationship between Amazon's top 100 most-reviewed products and the perceived helpfulness of their reviews. The chart depicts products as skyblue nodes, linked to helpfulness categories (green for "Highly Helpful," gold for "Moderately Helpful," and red for "Not Helpful"), representing how most of the product reviews have been rated by users in terms of usefulness.

Stay tuned for more visualizations and updates as the course progresses.
